# **App Name**: Real-Time Collaborative To-Do Board

## Core Features:

- Kanban Board: Kanban board with columns for 'Todo', 'In Progress', and 'Done'.
- Task Drag and Drop: Drag-and-drop functionality to move tasks between columns.
- Smart Assign: A 'Smart Assign' button that automatically assigns a task to the user with the fewest active tasks. Tool usage within a single query may be necessary in situations with larger lists.
- Activity Log Panel: Display of the last 20 actions (add/edit/delete/assign/drag-drop) performed on the board, updated live.
- Conflict Indicators: Visual indicators when two users edit the same task simultaneously, with options to merge or overwrite changes.
- Task Prioritization & Filters: Highlight tasks of different priority levels. Provide simple filtering of priority level.

- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop.
- Accent color: Coral (#E29578) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, neutral look; Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' for emphasis.
- Use simple, outlined icons from a set like Phosphor to represent task status and actions.
- Clean, card-based layout with clear visual separation between tasks and columns.
- Subtle transition animations when tasks are dragged and dropped between columns.
